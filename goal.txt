create a python program where a user can select a folder and the program will search all subfolders for pdfs. 

all uniquely numbered pdfs(use the first 9 numbers of the pdf name to identify uniqueness) 
are sorted by a specified document type(starting from the 13th position in the file name) then a pdf with be created 
created within a specified output folder.

Example: in the folder 01 there are 2 subfolders - 02 and 03.
within 02 there is one pdf named 123123123 - abc, one named 123123123 - cde one named 345345345 - abc, and one named 345345345 - cde.
within 03 there is one pdf named 123123123 - efg, one named 321321321 - abc one named 321321321 - cde, and one named 345345345 - efg.
given the specified document type order(abc, cde, efg) 
the output should be 3 pdfs in the specified output folder - 123123123.pdf, 345345345.pdf, and 321321321.pdf, each containing the merged pdfs in order of the specified document type order.

# Prioritized document types
    prioritized_types = ["Account File", "Contract_Note_Acct Agr", "Truth in Lending", "Bill Statement - CHARGE OFF", "Bill Statement", "Pay History"]  
    prioritized_types = ["Pay History", "Bill Statement", "Bill Statement - CHARGE OFF", "Truth in Lending", "Contract_Note_Acct Agr", "Account File"]
