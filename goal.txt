create a python program where a user can select a folder, and all uniquely numbered pdfs(use the first 9 numbers of the pdf name to identify uniqueness) 
within that folder and subfolders will be merged into separate pdfs.

Example: in the folder 01 there are 2 subfolders - 02 and 03.
within 02 there are two pdfs named 123123123 and two named 345345345.
within folder 03 there are two pdfs 321321321 and two pdfs name 543543543. 
the output should be 4 pdfs - 123123123.pdf, 345345345.pdf, 321321321.pdf, and 543543543.pdf each containing the merged pdfs with the unique name.
